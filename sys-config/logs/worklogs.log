Projects: 
1. P2P-Federated-Learning (Python, py-libp2p, Akave O3, Hedera hashgraph) :- A p2p federated learning stack built with py-libp2p, Akave O3 and Hedera blockchain.
	- Built a P2P federated learning network using py-libp2p for discovery, pubsub, and job coordination.
	- Used Hedera smart contracts + Consensus Service for trustless payments and training state auditing.
	- Enabled decentralized dataset/model transfer with Akave O3 presigned URLs (no credential sharing).
	- Designed an incentive flow where compute providers train locally and earn verifiable rewards.

2. LoyaltyX (Rust, Python, AI-agents, Near Blockchain) :- Agentic Al-driven decentralized loyalty program registration on the Near blockchain.
	- Businesses register unique loyalty programs onchain via the LoyaltyX chatbot.
	- Customers can earn, track and redeem loyalty points onchain by interacting with the Al Agent.
	- Al-agent backend process user requests and executes the required onchian transactions.

3. Tx-Validator (Rust, Bitcoin) :- Bitcoin transaction validation and block mining script from scratch.
	- Developed end-to-end Bitcoin block mining pipeline: tx-validation, merkle construction and PoW block header mining.
	- Implemented signature verification scripts for legacy and SegWit transaction types (P2PKH, P2SH, P2WPKH, P2WSH).
	- Prioritized transactions using fee/weight ratio for optimal block composition.
	- Constructed final block (~4M weight, ~21.6M sats fees, 4.4K txs) meeting target difficulty and Bitcoin serialization rules.
